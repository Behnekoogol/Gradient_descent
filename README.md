# Gradient_descent

Self-written Gradient descent Algorithm using Adaptive Step-size


- Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm that uses the gradient of the objective function to navigate the search space.
- Gradient descent can be updated to use an automatically adaptive step size for each input variable in the objective function, called adaptive gradients or AdaGrad.
